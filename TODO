Version Control:
Add version control by linking a github repo

Input:
Handle input better / more elegantly, there's a MUD called Evennia we could maybe steal from, but in general there are a lot of interesting text handling approaches out there

Movement:
Allow movement by greater/less distances

Time:
Allow updates of time, updates of time of different lengths i.e. prompt the player when they arrive at their destination or when something interesting happens (goblin!) etc

Combat:
entities have intents, try to enact them, prompt responses, varying time step by perception / ooda loop time of actor, which should scale with skill -- OODA is Observe, Orient, Decide, Act

Character:
Skills and attributes?

World:
Nested abstract structures, with different rules for internal coords

Vision:
describing the surroundings naturally based on player skills and positioning

Magic:
Someday, maybe?

LONG TERM:
Refactor / throw out and start over this entire thing with support for actual multiplayer, which will mean learning a server framework of some kind probably (because coding our own server from scratch doesn't sound particularly fun)

Nonlinear time? Bonus time for players who have not connecyted in a while?
